@#@# descriptive statistics dscribes data ex-mean,median etc
and Inferential statistics for making predictions. ex-Hypothesis testing

#Population and sample-
Population>>
The total amount of dataset

Sample>>
sample is a subset of population.
Some percent of total dataset.
we usually take sample beacuse its to big to work on whole population.
then we can perform measure of central tendency on sample.
ex-Exit polls.

We define s² in a way such that it is an unbiased sample variance.
The (n-1) denominator arises from Bessel’s correction

#Random variables-
@Numerical and categorical variable
Discrete>>
the Whole number,ex-3,5,2

Continous>>
the variable lies within range of values,ex-3.567,2.667

#Gaussian or Normal distribution>>
@distribution is found to perform scaling(SND-standard normal distribution(mu=0,si=1)).
A random variable x belongs to the gausian distribution(mu,sigma)(mean,SD).
follows a curve called bell curve.
(sd tell how far are the other quantities distributed from the mean while 
variance measures the average degree to which each point differs from the mean).

property of gaussian distribution-
Empirical Rule>>
probability(mu-si <= x <= mu+si)=68%
probability(mu-2si <= x <= mu+2si)=95%
probability(mu-3si <= x <= mu+3si)=99.7%

#LOG NORMAL DISTRIBUTION>>
when ln(x) belongs to a gaussian distribution.
it is right skewed.
(Skewness, in statistics, is the degree of asymmetry observed in a probability distribution)

#CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM-
if we take sample from random variable x, and n>=30 datapoint for each sample,
mean of all the sample will belong to a gaussian distribution
of mean(mu) and variance of (si)^2/n.

#CHEBYSHEV's Inequality-
if a random variable dosenot follow gaussian distribution then, the empirical rule for it-
probability(mu-Ksi <= x <= mu+Ksi) > 1-1/(K)^2

#COVARIANCE>>
gives the relation between two variables.
its equation can be derived that from of variance.
only tells us whether positively or negatively corelated
range can vary from -infinity to +infinity.

#PEARSON CORRELATION COFFECIENT-
formula = cov(x,y)/(si(x)*si(y))
ranges from(-1 to +1)
gives the exact value of corelation
useful in feature selection.

#SPEARMANS rank correlation>>
we use Pearson formula with rank of each value,
the rank of variable is find out and based on rank it provides the correlation.
Rank is the importance of Spearmans rank correlation

#Z-score>>
Tells in which standard deviation dataset falls into.
z=(X-mu)/si

#Normalization>>
x(norm) = (x-x(min))/(x(max) - x(min))
sklearn MINmax scaler

#standardization>>
formula zscore
sklearn StandardScaler
