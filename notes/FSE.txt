@we do feature selection due to curse of dimmensionality

#VarianceThreshold>>
Feature selector that removes all low variance features
This feature selection algorithm looks only at features(x),not desired output(y)
and can thus be used for unsupervised learning.
Threshold is a main param.

#Feature_selection -- Correlation>>
Remove the features which are highly correlated
do a train_test_split before to prevent overfitting.
